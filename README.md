## About Potato ##
Potato is a free remote control (RCON) tool for gameservers, currently supporting Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, Medal of Honor: Warfighter and Battlefield 4. It is developed by [Geoff Green](http://phogue.net) and also available as open source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/phogue/Potato "Potato on GitHub").

In addition to providing basic features to control your gameserver, users can extend Potato's functionality using plugins, which can control Potato's behavior and add additional possibilities for gameserver admins. Furthermore, Potato provides a layer system, which allows running plugins and managing admin accounts in a central location instead of distributing it to every admin connected to the gameserver.
