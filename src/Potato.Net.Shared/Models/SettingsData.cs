    /// Note that the property names will more than likely lengthen to very specific for their task.
    /// 
    /// We originally had a very good implementation by Cameron to handle generic additions by protocols to
    /// this list of settings, however they kind of broke the abstraction because we would then need to know
    /// what game was running and what additional variables were in this game. It could also mean clashes 
    /// between implementations of games that have identical variable names, but subtle or drastic differences
    /// in the value.
    /// 
    /// This class will more than likely blow out with very specific variable names - this is okay, this is almost
    /// perfect in fact. It means that a variable named "GameServerUpTimeSeconds" will always store the up time of
    /// the game server in a unit of seconds. A plugin seeking this information would always know where to look
    /// and various protocol implementations can reuse this variable along with any unit conversions required.
    /// 
    /// In all, I expect this class will have several hundred property names and if it means that conversion needs
    /// to be done in one location (protocol implementation) rather than within a plugin then it'll all be worth it.
